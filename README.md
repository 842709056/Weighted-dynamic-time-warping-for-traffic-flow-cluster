This is running code for paper: Weighted dynamic time warping for traffic flow clustering - 2021 Neurocomputing revision

Written by Taige Zhao, The University of Sydney, Nov 2020, version 1.0 

For the folder code_Matlab, each function file ending with .m in it helps you run the results in the paper on the matlab command line. Each result can be loaded in sequence after the preprocessing function.

For the result_output.ipynb file, we bring the calculated results into python to calculate their corresponding f1-score, and display the results.

All data sets are placed in the data folder.

The origional data is from https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/ and code reference: https://github.com/saeidsoheily/weighted-dynamic-time-warping
