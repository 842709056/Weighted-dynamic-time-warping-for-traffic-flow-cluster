# Weighted-dynamic-time-warping-for-traffic-flow-cluster
This is running code for paper: Weighted dynamic time warping for traffic flow clustering - Neurocomputing 2021

For the folder code_Matlab, each function file ending with .m in it helps you run the results in the paper on the matlab command line. Each result can be loaded in sequence after the preprocessing function.

For the result_output.ipynb file, we bring the calculated results into python to calculate their corresponding f1-score, and display the results.

All data sets are placed in the data folder
